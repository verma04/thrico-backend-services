# Community Safety & AI Moderation Guide

This guide explains how we keep our community safe using AI and what happens when content violates our standards.

## 1. The Content Lifecycle

Every piece of content created (Posts, Comments, and Chat Messages) goes through an automated safety check. This process happens in the background to ensure the platform remains fast and responsive.

### Step-by-Step Flow:

1. **Creation**: You post a comment, send a message, or share a post.
2. **AI Review**: An automated system reads the text to check for toxicity, spam, or harmful language.
3. **Action**: Depending on the "Safety Score" given by the AI, the system takes immediate action.
4. **Reputation Update**: Your community reputation (Risk Profile) is updated based on the quality of your contributions.

## 2. Safety Levels & Actions

Our system categorizes content into four main levels based on its safety score:

| Safety Level     | Action Taken  | Result for the User                                                                                     |
| :--------------- | :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Safe**         | `ALLOW`       | Content is visible to everyone as intended.                                                             |
| **Questionable** | `SHADOW HIDE` | The content is hidden from others, but you can still see it (so you don't feel "silenced" immediately). |
| **Harmful**      | `WARNING`     | You receive a formal warning. This affects your account's standing.                                     |
| **Severe**       | `BLOCK`       | The content is immediately removed, and your account is flagged for serious violations.                 |

## 3. Your Community Reputation (Risk Profile)

To protect the community from repeat offenders, every member has a hidden "Reputation Score" (Risk Profile).

### How the Score Changes:

- **Minor Violation (Warning)**: Adds a "strike" to your account.
- **Major Violation (Content Block)**: Significantly impacts your reputation.
- **Excessive Violations**: Once a reputation score reaches a certain threshold, the account may be automatically limited.

### Account Suspension

If a user consistently violates safety rules or performs an extremely severe action, the system will **Suspend** the account.

- **Suspended users** cannot post, comment, or send messages.
- Suspensions must be manually reviewed and cleared by a community administrator.

## 4. Admin Review

While the AI handles most cases automatically, our human administrators have the final say. They regularly review:

- Reports from other community members.
- Logs of AI-blocked content to ensure no mistakes were made.
- Suspended accounts to decide on permanent bans or reinstatements.

**Tip**: Always communicate with respect. If you feel your content was hidden or blocked by mistake, you can contact support for a manual review.
